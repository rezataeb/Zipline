# Zipline

In this piece, it's tried to extract some insights from Zip - fully autonomous drone - flights dataset which gathered at Zipline Inc. distribution center in Muhanga, Rwanda. 

The dataset consists of two main parts: 

(a) Summary of all flights  
(b) Motion attributes (position, velocity, acceleration, euler, etc.) of each flight.
